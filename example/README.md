This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It showcases every feature available on a vanilla React install. Read the parent README for instructions on how to user the **Scroller.Items** component.

It is linked to the react-app-limitless-scroller package in the parent directory for development purposes.

You can run `npm install` and then `npm start` to test your package.
